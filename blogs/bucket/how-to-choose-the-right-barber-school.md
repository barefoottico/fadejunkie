# How to Choose the Right Barber School for You

Not every school fits every student. Here’s how to know what to look for — and how to avoid wasting your time or money.

---

## Start with your learning style

Are you a hands-on learner?  
Do you need repetition and practice to get sharp, or do you retain fast?

Some schools are book-heavy. Others keep the clippers in your hand all day.

Pick one that matches your vibe.

---

## Talk to recent grads

Forget brochures.

DM a few people who just finished and ask them:

- How prepared did they feel for the state board exam?
- Did the school really teach them what mattered?
- Would they recommend it now that they’ve been on both sides — student AND licensed barber?

Real students > marketing.

---

## Look at the shop energy

Every school has a vibe.

Visit during class hours:

- Is it **organized chaos**, or just chaos?
- Are students practicing clean fades and sanitation?
- Are instructors actually coaching?
- Or is everyone just clocking hours?

The energy of the room matters more than the building itself.

## Check the state pass rate

In Texas, this stat is public.

Schools with consistently high pass rates usually have:

- Strong instructors  
- Solid curriculum  
- Real preparation for both written AND practical  

But don’t chase numbers blindly — balance it with how you feel about the environment and cost.

---

## Know what tools and extras are included

Some schools give you a full kit.  
Others hand you a list and send you to Amazon.

Before enrolling, ask:

- What’s included in the kit?
- Are there extra fees?
- Do they help you get clients for practice?
- What support exists **after** graduation?

Clear answers = a better investment.

---

## Bottom line

Choose the school that will actually get you licensed **and** set you up to win in a real barbershop.

Not just the closest one.  
Not just the cheapest one.  
The right one for **you**.
