# What is FadeJunkie?

_Not just a brand — a blueprint. Born from real grind, built for students, barbers, and clients who want more from the culture._

I started FadeJunkie after years of cutting without a license — getting good **before** I got approved. I built a name the long way. When I finally made it official, I saw the system didn’t support us — not really.

Students were lost.  
Licensed barbers were isolated.  
Clients didn’t know where to look.

## FadeJunkie is a lane for three types of people:

- **Students** — grinding toward that license with study tools, prep guides, and real context.
- **Barbers** — already licensed, growing their book, building their brand, sharpening their craft.
- **Clients** — people who want real fades, real skill, and none of the BS.

---

## It’s more than a directory.

FadeJunkie is a full ecosystem:

- eBooks  
- Flashcards  
- Test prep tools  
- Brand kits  
- Booking links  
- Mentorship  
- School finder  
- Barber profiles  

All organized by **lane** — student, barber, or client — so you always know exactly where to start.

## Built by barbers. Run by the culture.

No investors.  
No tech bros.  
No corporate agenda.

Just tools built by someone who lived the grind:

- Cutting without a license  
- Building a book from nothing  
- Navigating the barber school system  
- Learning business the long way  

Everything inside FadeJunkie exists because I needed it — and nobody was building it.
