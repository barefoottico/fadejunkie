# How to Properly Oil Your Clippers

Your tools are your reputation.  
Keep them fresh, smooth, and lasting longer by mastering this quick routine.

## Why oiling matters

Clippers aren’t meant to run dry.

Without oil, your blades:

- heat up faster  
- wear out quicker  
- pull on hair  
- get louder  
- lose cutting efficiency  

A few drops of oil prevent friction, protect the motor, and keep every cut crisp.

## What you need

All you need is **real clipper oil** — the kind made for barber tools.

Not WD-40.  
Not beard oil.  
Not coconut oil.  

Real clipper oil protects the motor, reduces friction, and won’t gunk up the mechanics.

## When to oil

At **minimum**, oil your blades:

- before your first cut of the day  
- after every sanitation spray or rinse  
- any time your clippers sound louder or feel rough  

Most pros oil every 2–3 cuts — it’s that quick and that worth it.

## How to oil (step-by-step)

1. Turn your clippers **on**.  
2. Hold them **sideways** with blades facing down.  
3. Apply **3 drops total** — one on each side of the blade and one in the middle.  
4. Let them run **10–15 seconds** to distribute the oil.  
5. Wipe off excess with a clean towel (especially near the teeth).

That’s it.  
30 seconds saves your clippers months of wear.

## Final tips

- Oil regularly, but don’t overdo it — too much oil traps hair and debris.  
- Oiling does **not** replace disinfecting between clients.  
- Keep your blades clean, aligned, and dry before storing them.  

> *Treat your tools right and they’ll pay you back every single cut.*
