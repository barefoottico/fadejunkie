## 🧑‍🎓 For Students

Whether you’re still in school or about to schedule state board, FadeJunkie is built to support your whole journey, not just one exam.

- Start in the **Students** section on the main site. That’s where you’ll find the core tools:
  - A **Flashcard Set** for written exam topics.
  - A **Practical eBook** that walks you through step-by-step what you’re expected to do on test day.

- Read blogs like:
  - _What to Expect on Test Day_
  - _10 Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting Barber School_

  These give you the context nobody explains in class.

- Plug into community:
  - Join study communities (Discord / group chats) linked from the Students lane.
  - Submit questions for Q&A-style blogs so your real problems get answered publicly.

The point is simple: instead of cramming alone, you use FadeJunkie as a hub for structured study, real stories, and game from people actually in the field.

## 💈 For Licensed Barbers

Once you’re licensed, FadeJunkie becomes more than study tools — it’s about your **brand**, your **traffic**, and your **network**.

Here’s how to use it as a working barber:

- **Claim and build your FadeJunkie profile**
  - Add your name, shop, specialties (fades, tapers, designs, etc.).
  - Link your existing booking system (Booksy, Cut, square booking, whatever you already use).
  - Treat it like a focused mini-website: clean, simple, client-facing.

- **Get featured in the Barber Spotlight**
  - FadeJunkie can highlight barbers that bring value: education, clean work, community moves.
  - That feature becomes a sharable asset you can link in your bio, text to clients, or show shops.

- **Network and mentor**
  - Use the platform to connect with other barbers in your city.
  - Offer mentorship or paid game to students who find you through the student lane.

- **Use it as a live portfolio**
  - Keep photos updated with your best work.
  - Add testimonials, IG handle, and booking links.
  - Over time, this becomes a record of your growth as a barber and brand.

FadeJunkie exists so you’re not just “another barber on Instagram.” It gives you a structured, neutral place to point people when they ask, “Where can I see your work?” or “How do I book?”

## ✂️ For Clients

If you’re a client, you don’t care about hours and state law. You care about **who can cut**, **how to book**, and **whether you can trust them**.

FadeJunkie for clients is built around that:

- **Search by what actually matters**
  - By **name** if you already know the barber.
  - By **city** if you’re new to the area.
  - By **cut style** (fades, tapers, bursts, designs, etc.) as that search evolves.

- **Read real reviews**
  - Focus on feedback from real clients — not bots or generic five-star spam.
  - You want to know: are they consistent? Are they on time? How’s the energy at the shop?

- **Book confidently**
  - Click through to the booking links barbers provide.
  - No weird middle system — you’re connecting to whatever they already use for appointments.

- **Save and follow barbers**
  - Build a personal list of barbers you like.
  - If you move or your schedule changes, you already have people bookmarked inside the ecosystem.

The goal is to make it easy for clients to find **real barbers** instead of gambling with random walk-ins.

## Why FadeJunkie Exists

FadeJunkie isn’t just a website or logo. It sits in the middle of three lanes:

- **Students** – who need structure, context, and clean study tools.
- **Barbers** – who need visibility, brand identity, and real-world opportunities.
- **Clients** – who just want a consistent, trustworthy cut.

Instead of everyone moving separately, FadeJunkie links them:

- Students see real barbers and real paths to the chair.
- Barbers see motivated students and potential clients.
- Clients see real barbers and get directed straight to them.

You don’t have to figure everything out solo or rely only on social media algorithms.

## How to Get the Most Out of It

If you want to actually use FadeJunkie instead of just browsing it:

- **Students**
  - Set up a study routine: flashcards + practical breakdown + one contextual blog a week.
  - Treat test day like a game you’re already familiar with, not a mystery.

- **Barbers**
  - Lock in your profile once, then keep it updated each month.
  - Use it as your “professional landing page” when talking to shops, clients, or brands.

- **Clients**
  - Try one FadeJunkie barber.
  - If you like the cut, favorite them and stay locked. If you don’t, now you know how to move through the ecosystem and find another one.
